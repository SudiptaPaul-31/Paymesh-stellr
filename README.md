## What it does

Paymesh is a decentralized payment platform that offers:

### Group Payments

- **Group Creation**: Set up payment groups with multiple Stellar wallet addresses and assign specific percentage splits for each member
- **Child Contract Creation**: We leverage Stellar Soroban technology to create individual child contracts for each group. Money can only be split exactly how the group creator set it up, ensuring complete security and transparency between everyone
- **Automated Distribution**: Any payment sent to your group's child contract instantly splits according to preset percentages - no manual intervention needed
- **Group Management**: Update group settings, extend usage limits, and manage subscription cycles as needed

### Crowdfunding

- **Campaign Creation**: Launch crowdfunding campaigns with customizable funding goals, deadlines, and descriptions
- **Transparent Fundraising**: All contributions are recorded on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring complete transparency for backers
- **Secure Fund Management**: Funds are held in smart contracts until campaign goals are met or refunded if targets aren't reached
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor campaign progress, view contributor lists, and track funding milestones in real-time
